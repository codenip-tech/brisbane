## Brisbane project

### for install encore
Please consider prior to anything else to create a copy of .env.example and rename it to .env

    // in the terminal
    $ yarn install

with that you have webpack-encore install and working (remember, we was previously installed "composer require symfony/webpack-encore-bundle")

### for install bootstrap

    // in the terminal
    $ yarn add bootstrap

thanks!
